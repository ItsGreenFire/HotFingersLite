    Setting the hotkey button will change what key activates the auto clicker. Click and type to use (Some characters cause crashes and mouse buttons are not yet working)

    *Ditto Hot Fingers Lite instructions*
    <br>
    The toggle/hold button allows you to either toggle on the auto clicker with the hotkey, or have to hold the hotkey down while you want the auto clicker activated.
    <br>
    Setting the power will change the speed at which the auto clicker clicks. There are three settings: "Slow", "Medium", "Fast".
    WARNING : Due to high CPU usage on "Fast", some games have a chance at crashing. Recommended for strong CPUs only.
